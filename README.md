## Artificial intelligence-enabled characterization of schizophrenia using risk essential biomarkers derived from transcriptomic analyses
## abstract
The reliable machine learning models based on transcriptomic-analysis to characterize schizophrenia risk is an ongoing thirst. Here, we developed a novel artificial intelligence pipeline to characterize schizophrenia from risk essential biomarkers (REBs). The pipeline was evaluated using brain RNA-sequencing data from the prefrontal cortex of 1,722 individuals. The final model characterizes schizophrenia using a 6-REB set with an area-under-the-curve of 0.77 in the validation set and 0.74 in the external test set. Annotations from large-scale genetic data and prior knowledge indicate that these REBs affect schizophrenia pathogenesis by neuro-inflammation and -development, and that schizophrenia polygenicity risk at the 6-REB set is efficient and higher than randomly selected gene sets. Moreover, animal experiments also confirmed the reliability of these REBs. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of transcriptomic-analysis-based objective characterization of schizophrenia risk, and presents preliminary evidence that our pipeline may be valuable for further understanding of schizophrenia pathogenesis and therapeutic targets.
